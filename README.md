## Installation
The project requires several python packages. The required packages are imported in the first cell. Please have a look and if you don't have them, go ahead and install them using pip or conda.

## Project Motivation
The project considers the most recent airbnb data for Sydney which can be downloaded from [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), and finds the answer to the following three questions: 

Question 1: Given your budget, where to look for an Airbnb home?
Question 2: The cheapest time to visit Sydney
Question 3: Using the information provided in a listing, can we predict its price?

## File Descriptions
The main file of the project is sydney_abnb.ipynb. The code is fully commented and should be self-contained. There are few .html files which are generated interactive maps showing homes which can accommodate a different number of guests on the map. 

## Results
The main findings are fully described in a medium post [here](https://medium.com/@m.chamanbaz/sydney-airbnb-homes-analysis-102a5db59dd1).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
